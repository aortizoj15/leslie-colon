              My name is Leslie Colon and I am from San Marcos, CA: A small city
              in the county of San Diego. I recently completed my Bachelor of
              Arts in Communication, specifically Mass Communication
              specializing in Public Relations and Advertising from California
              State University, Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up I was always a very social person and knew that I had
              to consider my communication skills when choosing a career. My
              interest in studying Communication began one Sunday night during a
              Sunday Night Football game, where I witnessed Erin Andrews
              interview football players on the field. Due to my love for
              football and my interest in traveling, I became curious and began
              to research what she studied and that's when I discovered that I
              would get my degree in Mass Communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my career within the media and entertainment industry as
              an intern at AfterBuzz TV. There, I was able to learn about the
              production environment and once I was offered the opportunity to
              audition as a host I did. I began to host After Shows,
              specifically about Wrestling and Reality TV including the WWE RAW
              After Show, Total Bellas, and I was even part of the first Spanish
              After Show for the new Latin Channel, AfterBuzz TV Latino.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only do I have experience as a host, but I also acquired a
              freelance position with Vesper Public Relations, specializing in
              PR within the Latin Market. While working side by side with the
              CEO of the company, I learned to set up red carpets while working
              events and have even worked with public figures for these events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am looking for a full-time position within the
              Entertainment and Media industry. Meanwhile, I am still working as
              an intern for companies helping with Social Media, Marketing, and
              take any projects to gain experience. I have also branched out on
              my own and launched my own Youtube channel, Caf√© con Leslie. So
              make sure you check out my channel and enjoy my conversations over
              a cup of Coffee!
